# Minimal Remarkable 2 streaming into a browser

Compile using `make`. Then copy binary to your Remarkable 2 and run it.
Finally connect a browser to `http://<remarkable-ip>:1113`.

Only tested with firmware 3.6.

This was implemented in 2 hours. Don't expect it to work. If it doesn't,
don't expect help. This code is provided as is and I won't offer any support.

Some ideas taken from https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream. Go there
for a supported tool with more features.
